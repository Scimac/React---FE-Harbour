## What is React js?

- The React.js framework is an open-source JavaScript framework and library developed by **Facebook**. 
- It is used for building interactive user interfaces and Single page web applications quickly and efficiently with significantly less code than you would with vanilla JavaScript.

- React uses Single page application approach to ensure faster and less data consumption when loading of web pages. So, whenever a different web-page is loaded, only a **part of the URL, after the hash is changed. This is called hash-based routing**.

- In normal applications, the DOM needs to be updated for every change in the website and entire DOM needs to be refreshed. 
- React creates a [Virtual DOM](Virtual%20DOM%20in%20React.md), which is a light-weight copy of the actual DOM. 
- React's virtual DOM is immediately reloaded to reflect this new change whenever there is a change in the data state. After which, React compares the virtual DOM to the actual DOM to figure out what exactly has changed. 
- Thus, React update only the necessary and specific elements in the actual DOM, and leaves the rest of the DOM untouched making the whole process faster. This technique is called as **Reconcilliation in React**.
