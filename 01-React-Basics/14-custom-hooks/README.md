### Creating custom hooks

- A custom hook is a JS function whose name starts with `use`
- A custom hook can call other hooks if required
- It helps in sharing the logic and can be considered as a simpler alternative to HOC or render props.

- [Checkout the `useInput()` hook, very interesting implementation ](./src/components/hooks/useInput.js)
