### Session 1: Introduction to Redux
**Duration: 2 hours**

1. **Introduction to State Management**
   - Explanation of state management in React.
   - Challenges with state management in large applications.

2. **Introduction to Redux**
   - Overview of Redux and its benefits.
   - Understanding the Redux principles: single source of truth, state is read-only, changes made with pure functions.

3. **Redux Core Concepts**
   - Actions: What are actions? How to define actions.
   - Action creators: Writing action creator functions.
   - Reducers: What are reducers? How to write reducers.

4. **Redux Store**
   - Creating a Redux store.
   - Using `redux-thunk` middleware for async actions (if time permits).

5. **Redux DevTools**
   - Introduction to Redux DevTools and how to install/use them.
   - Basic debugging with Redux DevTools.

### Session 2: Advanced Redux Concepts
**Duration: 2 hours**

1. **Connecting Redux with React**
   - Integrating Redux with a React application using `react-redux`.
   - Using `Provider` to provide the Redux store to React components.

2. **Container Components and Presentational Components**
   - Understanding the difference between container and presentational components.
   - Writing container components to connect Redux store to React components.

3. **Selectors**
   - What are selectors?
   - Writing selectors to derive data from Redux store.

4. **Async Actions**
   - Handling asynchronous actions in Redux using middleware (`redux-thunk`).
   - Writing async action creators.

5. **Middleware**
   - Overview of Redux middleware.
   - Custom middleware implementation (optional, depending on time).

### Session 3: Advanced Redux Topics and Best Practices
**Duration: 2 hours**

1. **Immutable Update Patterns**
   - Understanding immutability in Redux.
   - Using immutable libraries like Immutable.js (optional).

2. **Redux Toolkit**
   - Introduction to Redux Toolkit and its benefits.
   - Converting existing Redux code to use Redux Toolkit.

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Memoization and reselect for performance optimization.
   - Techniques to prevent unnecessary renders.

4. **Best Practices and Common Patterns**
   - Best practices for structuring Redux code.
   - Common patterns like normalized state shape, split reducers, etc.

5. **Testing Redux**
   - Overview of testing Redux code.
   - Writing unit tests for Redux actions, reducers, and selectors.

6. **Deploying Redux Apps**
   - Brief overview of deploying Redux applications.

7. **Q&A and Recap**
   - Open floor for questions and answers.
   - Recap of key concepts covered throughout the bootcamp.

Make sure to allocate time for interactive activities, coding exercises, and Q&A sessions in each session to reinforce learning and clarify doubts. Additionally, provide resources for further self-study and practice. Adjust the content and pace based on the participants' understanding and feedback.
