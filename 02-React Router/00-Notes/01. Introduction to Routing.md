- Routing is a fundamental concept in web development that enables navigation between different pages or views within a web application. 
- It allows users to move seamlessly between various sections of the application, enhancing user experience and interactivity.

### What is Routing?

- Routing refers to the process of determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, URI, or URL. 
- It involves mapping URLs to specific actions or resources within the application, allowing users to access different parts of the application based on the requested URL.
### Traditional Routing Methods

Before the advent of single-page applications (SPAs) and client-side routing libraries, web applications primarily relied on traditional routing methods, including:

1. **Server-Side Routing**:
   - In server-side routing, the routing logic is handled entirely on the server. When a client makes a request to a specific URL, the server determines the appropriate response and sends back the corresponding HTML page.

2. **HTML Hyperlinks**:
   - HTML hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) were used to navigate between different pages of a website. Clicking on a hyperlink triggered a new HTTP request to the server, resulting in the loading of a new HTML page.

3. **Form Submissions**:
   - HTML forms were another mechanism for triggering navigation between pages. When a user submitted a form, the browser sent a POST or GET request to the server, which then responded with a new HTML page.

4. **URL Parameters**:
   - URL parameters allowed for dynamic routing by including variable values directly in the URL. Servers could parse these parameters to determine the appropriate response or content to return.
### Advantages of Traditional Routing Methods

- **Simple Implementation**: Traditional routing methods are straightforward to implement, requiring basic HTML and server-side logic.
- **SEO-Friendly**: Server-side routing ensures that search engines can crawl and index individual pages of the website, improving search engine optimization (SEO).
- **Robustness**: Server-side routing can handle complex routing logic and authentication requirements directly on the server, enhancing security and reliability.
### Limitations of Traditional Routing Methods

- **Page Reloads**: Each navigation action triggers a full page reload, resulting in slower user experiences and increased server load.
- **Limited Interactivity**: Traditional routing methods lack the real-time updates and interactivity offered by client-side routing in SPAs.
- **Scalability**: Scaling server-side routing can be challenging, especially for applications with high traffic volumes or complex routing requirements.
### Traditional Multi-Page Applications (MPAs)

- Before SPAs gained prominence, the majority of web applications followed a multi-page architecture. 
- In this paradigm, each user interaction, such as clicking a link or submitting a form, triggered a request to the web server, resulting in the reloading of the entire webpage.

- **Characteristics of MPAs:**
	- **Page Reloads**: Every user interaction necessitated a full page reload, where the browser requested a new webpage from the server.
	- **Server-Side Rendering**: Web servers were responsible for generating complete HTML pages in response to client requests.
	- **Resource Intensive**: MPAs consumed significant server resources and bandwidth, especially for complex applications with frequent user interactions.
### Challenges with Traditional MPAs

1. **Performance Overhead**: Full page reloads led to slower user experiences, particularly for applications with dynamic content.
2. **Bandwidth Consumption**: Transmitting entire webpages for each request resulted in inefficient use of network bandwidth.
3. **Server Load**: Generating complete HTML pages for every interaction imposed a heavy computational burden on web servers.

### Limitations of MPAs

- **Limited Interactivity**: Each interaction required a round trip to the server, hindering real-time updates and interactivity.
- **Suboptimal User Experience**: Slow page loads and frequent interruptions detracted from the overall user experience.
- **Scalability Concerns**: As web applications grew in complexity, scaling traditional MPAs became challenging due to resource constraints.

## Conclusion:

- The era before Single-Page Applications was characterized by traditional multi-page architectures, where each user interaction triggered a full page reload. 
- While MPAs served as the foundation of web development, they were limited in terms of performance, interactivity, and scalability.
